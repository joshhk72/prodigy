`[Verse 1]
I can touch the ceiling with my feet, I can, I can
Hidden from the street with you, and I know this is not our place
But we can always live as if it is, we can, we can
Paris is a dream come true
And we don't even need to explore

[Chorus 1]
I got out, I got free, you don't got no hold on me
I don't feel no side effects when you're gone
I want love, I got some, thank God it isn't what it was
I don't feel no side effects when you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
When you're gone, when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
I can touch the ceiling with my feet, I can, I can
Lying by the sea with you, and I know this is not our place
But we can always swim as if it is, weekend, weekend
Damn, this is a dream come true
And we don't we even need to explore

[Chorus 1]
I got out, I got free, you don't got no hold on me
I don't feel no side effects when you're gone
I want love, I got some, but thank God it isn't what it was
I don't feel no side effects when you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
When you're gone, when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone, gone, gone

[Chorus 2]
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
So good, so good

[Bridge]
Minus thirteen, we were sleeping in all of our clothes
Air streaming beautiful, so fucking beautiful
I just fell in love

[Chorus 2]
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good (So, so good)
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good (So, so good)
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good (So, so good)
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good (So, so good)
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
What it is, what it is, what it is, it's so good
So good, so good`
